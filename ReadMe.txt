Steps to have a searchable offline directory from this repo:

1. Download, Clone or Fork this Repo. (links won't work as is)
2. Download and install Snap2HTML for your system. (https://github.com/rlv-dan/Snap2HTML)
3. Open Snap2HTML and select the "HOME" directory as your root folder.
4. Rename the Page title from the long "Snapshot of..." to something cool like "Survival Data".
5. Make sure to Enable Linked files.

7. Save the HTML page as the index.html located in the repo root.
8. enjoy an offline searchable Survival database.

Good luck!
